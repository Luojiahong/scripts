This file details the uses of the files in the ~/scripts/python/workflow
directory. On 1-4-2017 I undertook a restructure of my scripts directories
in order to ease lookup of useful code and, most importantly, to transition
my old code into functions capable of import into a python interpreter. I will
update this file as new files are created but the idea here is to create
fewer, over-arching files and instead add new functions to these files.

A preliminary structure might look like this:

data_prep.py: Functions to take raw miniseed and sc3ml files and output
              usable QML and pyasdf files for use in main workflows. This
              includes functionality for creating templates.

relocate.py: Functions for relocating events in catalogs. This should be for
             NLLoc as well as HypoDD (or better yet, TomoDD).

mag_calc.py: Wrappers on magnitude calculation functions in EQcorrscan for
             matched filter detections.

Add more here as we need them.

The obvious exception here are going to be the scripts for PAN which will
probably stay as they are (wont convert them to functions). If it ain't
broke, don't fix it.
