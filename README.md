# scripts
## Description
This repository contains all the top level functions and scripts for my PhD workflow at Victoria University of Wellington, Wellington, New Zealand.

**PhD title:** Microseismicity at Rotokawa and Ngatamariki Geothermal Fields, North Island, New Zealand 

Mostly this is just a backup/sync between multiple machines. Most of the work is done in Python so that is the most actively maintained directory.

## Acknowledgments  
These scripts rely heavily upon other Python packages including, but not limited to:
* [EQcorrscan](https://eqcorrscan.github.io/)
* [Obspy](https://docs.obspy.org/)
* [Obspyck](https://github.com/megies/obspyck)
